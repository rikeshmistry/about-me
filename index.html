      <h2>Rikesh Mistry</h2>
      <p>I'm 29, I graduated in Graphic Design with a passion for all things creative and I enjoy learning new skills. I'm eager to learn about Web Development/Design and understand the logics, technical skills involved to make beautiful websites. I'm especially excited to learn Javascript including the other programs in the Made By Milk Web Design course. I will then be able to use these transferrable skills for future clients and job opportunities.</p>
